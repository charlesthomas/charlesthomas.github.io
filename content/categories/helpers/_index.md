title: "ï£¿ macOS Helper Apps"
---

I've been trying to find a way to quickly refer people to info about what I call "Helper Apps."
These are macOS apps that typically sit up in the system tray and do something especially useful.

My original idea was to have a single page that I kept updated with the apps I'm currently using, but that became fairly hard to manage as things came and went.

Now, my plan is to write a dedicated blog post when I add, remove, replace one of these apps.

All of the posts will be collected here.
