I have been using macOS for the better part of a decade, and over that time I’ve found several little helper apps that I don’t think I could function without.
I also recommend them to people frequently, so I compiled a list for faster linking.

## Meetings

- [Meeter](https://trymeeter.com/)
  - Actionable alerts that open the meeting in the native app, no matter which one it is
  - Works with Zoom, Google, WebEx, Blue Jeans, etc
- [Muzzle](https://muzzleapp.com/)
  - Auto-enable Do Not Disturb mode when initiating screen sharing, regardless of meeting app
- [Shush](https://mizage.com/shush/)
  - Push-to-Talk app mutes your microphone unless you’re holding down the function key
- [AirBuddy](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/63730/airbuddy)
  - macOS is surprisingly terrible for connecting BlueTooth audio devices
  - AirBuddy makes it much better, by mimicking the pop-ups you see on an iPhone when your AirPods are nearby.
  - I used to use [ToothFairy](https://c-command.com/toothfairy/) which is also good

## System

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
  - More customizable, more powerful Spotlight replacement
  - I have been meaning to try [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), and if you aren't already using Alfred, you should probably start with it instead
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/)
  - Declutter your system tray and hide all these silly little apps by default
- [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/)
  - macOS is _awful_ at window management. Magnet addresses that with hotkeys & click-and-drag options for organizing windows
  - I used to use [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/) for this, but it's outrageously expensive compared to alternatives

## Other

- [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/)
  - System-wide Slack-style :emoji:
- [Choosy](https://www.choosyosx.com/)
  - Set Choosy as your default browser, and forward links to other browsers using custom rules
  - For example: work links go to one browser, personal links to another
  - Choosy doesn't sync across computers, which is a huge bummer. If there's an alternative that does, please let me know!
- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)
  - The best calendar-in-system-tray app I’ve seen
  - Also includes functionality similar to Meeter, although I prefer Meeter for joining meetings
- [Carrot Weather](http://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/mac/)
  - The best weather app for iOS is also pretty good on macOS
- [SceneCuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scenecuts/id1540491573?mt=12)
  - Run Apple Home Scenes from your system tray!
