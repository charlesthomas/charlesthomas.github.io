For the last week or so [winter has hit the midwest pretty hard](https://www.wzzm13.com/article/weather/severe-weather/updated-snowfall-totals-from-around-west-michigan-1142024/69-8f0ee736-4883-4da1-a205-df9ecd2ee303).
I had somewhere to be this afternoon, so I had to go dig my car out.
It took about an hour and a half, based on my

and
[post](https://social.lol/@ct/111789087678721858)
toots.

While I was out there, I had plenty of time to think.
Somewhere along the way this post started forming in my mind.
So here we go.
Snow shoveling as an analogy for good incident response.

# Order of operations matters.

I keep a duffel bag in my car with emergency winter gear: good boots, an extra hat and coat, and most important here, waterproof gloves.
The problem was that the gloves were in the trunk, but the trunk was too covered to open.
To dig the trunk out, I needed to use the brush.
But the brush was in the car, and the doors were covered.
Just to get started, I had to clear a door without tools, get the brush, then use the brush to get to the good gloves.
By that time the gloves I was already wearing were starting to get wet on the inside.
If I hadn't gone for the gloves first, I'd still be thawing my fingers.

# Let the tools do the work.

Failing that, let them help.
The first thing I did after getting into the car was turn it on and put the front and rear window defrosters on.

# Assess the situation and make a plan.

I started by clearing the roof, then working my way down. If I had cleared the windshield first and then done the roof a bunch of snow would have fallen onto the windshield, and I'd have had to do the same work twice.

# Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.

There was so much snow on the car that there were discrete layers.
The bottom layer was much more compact and harder to clear.
Rather than trying to get it all in one go, I did two passes. First I cleared the easy top layer, _then_ I dug in on the hard-pack layer.
This was less effort than if I had tried to move all that weight at once, trying to dig through both layers.
Plus this gave the car time to warm up and loosen the hard pack from the inside out.

# Sometimes solving the problem causes other problems.

I took so much snow off the top of my car that it piled high enough to block the doors, so I couldn't get back into the car to turn it off.
Not to mention that when I was ready to leave, I'd have a hard time pulling out.
Now that the car was clear, I was going to have to dig it out.

# Anticipate problems; solve for them in advance.

I had a shovel in the trunk, but I keep it in two parts so it packs down smaller.
I couldn't get the screw out of the handle to put the shovel head on.
... But I keep a screw driver in the car.

# If your tools aren't well maintained, they can be a hazard.

The shovel telescopes, but the extended peg-hole is blocked so it isn't safe to use with the handle extended.

# Sometimes there's nothing you can do but embrace the suck.

I had to use the shovel anyway, without it extended. It was do-able, but much less pleasant than if I had had a functioning shovel.

# Moving the problem can solve the problem.

I dug out only enough to be able to pull the car out, and then I parked in a spot that had been plowed.

# Sometimes solving the problem reveals other problems.

Once I started moving, my tire pressure sensors all lit up.

# Having the right tools helps tremendously ...

My brother got me a new tire pump for Christmas, because around this time last year my other one gave up the ghost.
It worked a treat to reinflate the tires.

# ... if you know how to use them

Except that I wasn't really thinking about what I was doing when I connected it to the first tire.
I connected the hose to the tire before the pump, so a bunch of air leaked out until I could connect it to the pump.

# If you can, buy your way out
